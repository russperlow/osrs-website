    <h2 id='welcome-text'>Welcome to Russ' OSRS Helper! Current tools are the Grand Exchange Tracker and the Drop Calculator</h2>
    <h3 class='intro-title'>Grand Exchange:</h3>
    <p class='intro-text'>
        The Grand Exchange Calculator uses the average sale of the last 180 days. All tradable items, both F2P and P2P can be
        looked up for their prices. Along with day to day prices, the items trend can be viewed, perfect for merching. Along
        with the graph, the items are displayed with their low and high alchemy values, and percentages of increase/decrease in price 
        over the last 30, 90 and 180 days.
    </p>
    <h3 class='intro-title'>Drop Rate Calc:</h3>
    <p class='intro-text'>
        The drop rate calculator will help show a visual representation for where you stand based on your current kill count for a drop
        and the probability you would have received the drop by now, along with the chance over either double your current kill count or
        the drop rate (whichever is larger). There is also a built in feature for pet kill counts. You may toggle that option, enter your
        RSN and which boss you would like to calculate. The information will be pulled from the most recently update OSRS hiscores page. 
        If your numbers seem in correct, you may need to log out or view your collection log to make sure it properly updates.
